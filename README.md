# How To Make Your First Pull Request

## 1. Add your profile picture to the folder

Add a profile picture of your choice in `images/`. Accepted files are **png** and **jpg**, Ex.

```
images/<YOUR-USERNAME>.png
```

## 2. Add your profile information

Create a markdown file in your folder following the convention `participant/<YOUR-USERNAME>.md`. Ex.

```
participant/<YOUR-USERNAME>.md
```

Copy the next template into your file, delete the boilerplate data and fill the information with yours.

```
---
name: YOURNAME
institution/company: INSTITUTION_NAME
github:USERNAME
---
```

## 3. Wait for Pull Request to merge

## 4. Here is a quick reference guide for GitHub: [GitHub Guide](https://github.com/git-guides)

## 5. Celebrate - you've done your first pull request!!

- Aim to make more than 4 pull requests.
- Imagine you've only made 4 pull requests to different projects, but one of those projects isn't part of the Hacktoberfest event.
- In that case, your pull request won't be counted, leaving you with just 3 valid ones if those projects aren't excluded either.
- To ensure your success, I recommend making a pull request to your own repo, as long as it has the Hacktoberfest topic.

# How To Make Your First Pull Request

## 1. Add your profile picture to the folder

Add a picture picture of your choice in `assets/images/<YOUR-USERNAME>.png`. Accepted files are **png** and **jpg**, Ex.

```
assets/images/<YOUR-USERNAME>.png
```

## 2. Now, please navigate to the `index.html` file, open it, read the instructions in the code, copy down the line and add your information.

## 3. Change the class name below

So, essentially, you are instructing the reader to change the class name of the first <div> element to include a number that corresponds to their specific use case. For instance, if their number is 2, the modified code would look like this:

```
<div class="card_img card2">
   <div class="plus"></div>
</div>
```

## 4. Now, please navigate to the `style.css` file, read the instructions, and add the class `.card(as your number is)` along with the image path.

`url('assets/images/<YOUR-USERNAME>.png')`
