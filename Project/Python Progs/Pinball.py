'''
    
    This code generates a random pinball
    gameboard, and you don't have to input
    anything.
    
    But if you want, input the first int,
    which decides the amount of balls.
    
    And then if you keep giving inputs,
    they will be the strength you shoot
    each balls. If you give no inputs,
    the strength will be random.
    
    Up to now, the size of the gameboard
    is 10 holes with height 15. Maybe I'll
    make it resizeable when I have time.
    
    
    Update: Sizes are changeable now!
